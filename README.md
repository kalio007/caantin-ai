## **Getting Started**

### **1. Run with Docker**
The project is containerized for easy setup. To start the development environment:  

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t script-builder .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 script-builder
```

Then, open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

### **2. Run Locally (Alternative)**
If running without Docker, follow these steps:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```
